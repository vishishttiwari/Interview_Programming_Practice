/*Check if a given graph is tree or not
Write a function that returns true if a given undirected graph is tree and false otherwise. For example, the following graph is a tree.

cycleGraph

But the following graph is not a tree.
cycleGraph

An undirected graph is tree if it has following properties.
1) There is no cycle.
2) The graph is connected.

For an undirected graph we can either use BFS or DFS to detect above two properties.
